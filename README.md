# Automated-disease-detection-from-X-ray-and-CT-Scan-Images-using-Deep-learning
This project presents an automated disease detection system using deep learning to analyze X-ray and CT-scan images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to identify diseases . The model improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports faster medical decision-making in healthcare systems.
